# PATCH NOTES (v4) -- Fix survival-mode false triggers (self-inflicted collapse)
#
# Diagnosed from 5 lost replays (81341940, 81342110, 81344073, 81354283,
# 81370266), all played as "ola sadek". Cross-referencing replay state against
# the v3 macro-phase logic step-by-step (not just at the old hoard checkpoint)
# revealed something the v3 diagnosis missed: SURVIVAL mode itself -- the
# "fight back instead of hoarding while being erased" fix from v3 -- was
# firing almost continuously, including at step 0 of every single game.
#
# Root cause: survival_planet_count=2 triggers on "owned_planets <= 2". Every
# game starts at exactly 1 planet. So survival mode (frontier_reserve_margin
# *0.12, i.e. near-zero defensive reserve, max_waves_per_turn>=10) was active
# from turn one, and kept re-triggering through the midgame any time the agent
# dipped to 1-2 planets during ordinary combat -- not just genuine last-stands.
#
# Concretely, in 81344073 at step 135 ola had owned_planets=2, ratio=0.17 (so
# survival correctly should have fired for being behind) -- but with
# frontier_reserve_margin gutted, the agent emptied BOTH of its planets in one
# turn (228->35 ships, 366->107 ships) launching two ~200+ ship offensive
# waves while leaving ~0 garrison at home. Neither wave ever landed a capture
# that stuck; both home planets fell within 2-5 steps to a trivial counter-
# attack, because there was nothing left to defend them. The same pattern
# (full-bank offensive dump + near-zero garrison right before the planet is
# lost) shows up near the collapse point in all 5 losses, not just one.
#
# Survival mode's intent (fight, don't hoard, while dying) was right. The bug
# is that it disabled defense *while* going all-in on offense, instead of
# choosing one. An agent at 1-2 planets needs to defend what it has at least
# as much as it needs to counter-attack -- emptying your last planet to send
# a wave is how you get eliminated one turn before that wave would have
# mattered anyway.
#
# FIX (three changes):
#   1. Early-game grace period: survival_grace_steps=20. Owning few planets
#      in the opening is normal start-of-game state, not a crisis -- don't
#      gate behavior on it.
#   2. Planet-count survival trigger raised from "<=2" to "<=1" (only a true
#      last-stand), with a separate softer trigger for "<=2 planets AND
#      ratio<=0.55" so genuinely-losing-with-2-planets still counts, but
#      having 2 modest planets while roughly even isn't treated as dying.
#   3. Survival mode no longer guts frontier reserve to near-zero. Reserve
#      scale raised from 0.12 to 0.45 -- still much thinner than normal play
#      (so the agent does commit more to offense than usual) but no longer
#      removes the defensive floor entirely. A last-stand agent should still
#      keep enough ships home to make the enemy pay to finish it off; an
#      empty planet falls for free and wastes the offensive wave that drained
#      it, since by the time that wave could return, there's nothing left to
#      return to.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PATCH NOTES (v3) -- Conditional hoard + survival mode
#
# Diagnosed from 4 lost replays (81241069, 81246396, 81262906, 81266346).
# All 4 games ended via player elimination at steps 130-239 (NOT the 500-step
# scoring endpoint), so the dump phase (last 100 steps of 500 = step 400+)
# NEVER fired.  The games were already over before it was supposed to help.
#
# Root cause confirmed by replaying phase tags against every planet-loss event:
#   81241069: 13 of 19 planet losses tagged HOARD(WEAK-SHOULD-NOT-HOARD)
#   81246396: 11 of 16 planet losses tagged HOARD(WEAK-SHOULD-NOT-HOARD)
#   81262906: 16 of 24 planet losses tagged HOARD(WEAK-SHOULD-NOT-HOARD)
#   81266346: 10 of 11 planet losses tagged HOARD(WEAK-SHOULD-NOT-HOARD)
#   At the hoard trigger (step 90), strength ratios were 0.58-0.92 with
#   planet counts as low as 3.  The hoard phase fired UNCONDITIONALLY despite
#   ola being behind or equal, which turned a recoverable position into a
#   death spiral: hoard → stop attacking → lose more planets → weaker still.
#
# The previous version misread what made Isaiah's strategy work.  Isaiah
# COULD hoard because he was already WINNING (more planets, more ships).
# Hoarding while losing just compounds the deficit.  The bank never gets
# big enough to matter when you're getting eliminated before step 400.
#
# FIX (three changes that together cover all 4 failure modes):
#   1. Hoard gating: hoard only fires when ratio >= 0.95 (essentially tied
#      or ahead) AND owned_planets >= 5. Under the new rule, NONE of the 4
#      losing games would have triggered hoard at step 90.  Planet losses
#      now tagged correctly as EXPAND or SURVIVAL throughout.
#   2. Softer hoard when it DOES fire: roi_floor 2.4→1.65, max_waves 2→4.
#      The original values were extreme enough to completely freeze expansion
#      even when the agent was slightly ahead.
#   3. Survival mode (new): when ratio <= 0.32 OR planets <= 2, override
#      everything -- ROI floor to 1.05, waves to 10, reserve scale to 0.12.
#      This makes the agent fight back in a death spiral instead of hoarding
#      while being erased.
#   Also: dump_window 140→100 (fires 40 steps earlier); anti-drip floor
#   scales min_ships_to_launch with total owned mass so the agent doesn't
#   spend wave slots on 4-ship trickle attacks when it has 400 ships banked.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# PATCH NOTES (v2) -- "hoard then dump" macro phase
#
# Source: forensic analysis of 4 replays of the top leaderboard opponent
# ("Isaiah @ Tufa Labs", 80824418, 80830575, 80832496, 80831272).
# Key facts: ships on planets grow +prod/turn with NO cap; winner in every
# replay was the player with more total ships (planets + in-flight) at game
# end, even with fewer planets/production; and the winning action log showed
# a short expansion burst, a 200-300 step quiet compound phase, then a
# one-shot dump in the last 100-140 steps.
#
# FIX (v2): _suppress_late_candidates payback-time decay switched off in
# the dump window; step-gated phase config applied via _adjust_config.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PATCH NOTES (v1) -- frontier garrison reserve
#
# Diagnosed from 4 lost replays (81124742, 81128990, 81139010, 81141173):
# every single loss followed the same pattern -- a frontline planet with a
# healthy garrison got selected as an offensive SOURCE purely because it had
# a lot of ships (source_score only rewards ships/prod/centrality), got
# drained to ~0-5 ships by an outgoing wave, and was overrun 1-3 steps later
# by an enemy fleet that only needed to match the now-tiny garrison.
#
# _build_defense_entries already projects threats to planets, but it runs
# BEFORE plan_lite_waves and has no visibility into what plan_lite_waves is
# about to drain from those same planets this turn -- so a planet can look
# "safe" to the defense pass and then get stripped bare by the offense pass
# a few lines later, with neither pass aware of the other's plan.
#
# FIX: give every potential source planet a computed "frontier reserve" --
# an estimate of how many ships a nearby enemy could plausibly throw at it
# within a short horizon (reusing the existing cheap_enemy_pressure signal,
# which the code already computed for targets but never applied to sources).
# That reserve is subtracted from what's available to drain for offense.
# Interior planets far from any enemy keep a ~0 reserve and lose no
# offensive capacity; frontline planets keep enough to survive a plausible
# counter-attack instead of being emptied out by their own agent.
